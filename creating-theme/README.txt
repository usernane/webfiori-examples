This example shows how to create a very basic theme. 
Inside the folder 'themes/custom-theme' you will find the 
core theme components. 
After creating the theme, we have created a simple view to see how the theme 
will look like.
Finally, we have added a route to the view in order to see how it will 
be in the web browser window.
